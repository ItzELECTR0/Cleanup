# ELECTRO's Cleanup Program

This little program lets you add files and/or directories which will be deleted on system startup OR when the program is run.
On first-run the program will give you a configuration menu. To access this menu again, run the app with '--config' tag.

There is a persistent mode which is activated per session and will continously check for the files/directories you add
It will delete them immediately.
